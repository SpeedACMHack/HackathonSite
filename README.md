#DerbyHacks
This repo was forked from the wonderful [Kent Hack Enough](https://github.com/hacksu) Organization's website. It was designed by Paul Dilyard (@pdilyard) to make KHE the best it could be. It is now being used to make DerbyHacks the best that it can be.
This version of the Repo is managed by Shayne Hemminger.
